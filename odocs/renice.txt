One Day One Command 
===================

renice -- Alter priority of running processes.

Summary:

GNU/Linux is a multi-user and multi-tasking OS. So many processes will
be running with some scheduling policy like Round Rabin, FIFO etc..
High priority process will get more CPU Time.

Renice is used to alters the scheduling priority of one or more
running processes. Priority range goes from -20 (highest priority)  
to 19 (lowest priority).

Examples:

$ renice +1 123 -- Increment the priority value of a process, which 
                   process ID is 123.

# renice +1 123 -- Decrement the priority value of a process, which 
                   process ID is 123. (Root only can decrement ).

$ renice +1 -p 123 -p 200 -- Same as above. Here no. of process is 2.

$ renice +1 -u sbharathi -- Increment the priority value of all 
                     processes, which is owned by a user (sbharathi).

$ renice +1 -g backup -- Increment the priority value of all
               processes, which is owned by a group (backup).


NOTE: Incrementing the priority value will reduce the priority level 
      and vice versa. Priority range is -20 (high) to 19 (low).
