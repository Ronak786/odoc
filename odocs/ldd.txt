One Day One Command 
===================

ldd -- Print shared Library DepenDencies.

Summary:

Most of the programs/libraries are linked to shared libraries, like
libc, etc. If a particular shared library, needed by a xyz program, is
not present in the system, then xyz program will not run.

ldd command is used to print the shared libraries required by each
program or shared library specified on the command line.

Examples:

$ ldd /bin/ls -- Print all shared libs needed for the ls command.

$ ldd -v /bin/ls -- Same as above + Extra details.

$ ldd /lib/libtermcap.so.2 -- Print all shared libs needed for this
                              library.
