One Day One Command :-
====================

ln -- Make LiNks between files.

Summary : 

Create a link to the specified TARGET with optional LINK_NAME. If
LINK_NAME is omitted, a link with the same basename as the TARGET 
is created in the current directory. By default, it makes HardLinks.

A "hard link" is another name for an existing file. The link and the
original are indistinguishable.  They share the same inode.

A Soft links/Symbolic links/symlinks are a special file type. The link
file actually refers to a different file, by name. At runtime kernel
automatically "dereferences" the link and operates on the target of
the link.

Example:

$ ln --help -- Show help info.

$ ln A B -- Creates hard link B for file A.  

$ ln -b A B -- Same as above. If B is already exist then Take a backup 
               (B~) and creates new B.

$ ln -b -S .bak A B -- Same as above. If B is already exist then Take 
        a backup with specified extention name(B.bak) & creates new B.

$ ln -f A B -- Force. If B is exist then overwrite it.

$ ln -i A B -- Interactive. Prompt the user for removing the already 
               existing file B.

$ ln -s A B -- Creates soft link B for file A.

$ ln -s dir1/myfile -- Creates link ./myfile pointing to dir1/myfile.

$ ln -s dir1/myfile myfile -- Creates link ./myname pointing to 
                               dir1/myfile.

$ ln -s a b .. -- Creates links ../a and ../b pointing to ./a & ./b
