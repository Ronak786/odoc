$ strings /bin/ls -- Prints the strings from initialized & loaded
                     sections.

$ strings -a file -- Scan the whole file for the strings.

$ strings -f /bin/* | grep Free -- Print Filename before each string.

$ strings -t o file -- Print the offset within the file before each  
                      string [o = octal, x = hex, d = decimal].

$ strings -n 10 file -- Print sequences of characters that are at
                        least 10 characters long (Default 4).
