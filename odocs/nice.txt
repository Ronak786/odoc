One Day One Command 
===================

nice -- Run a command with modified priority.

Summary:

GNU/Linux is a multi-user and multi-tasking OS. So many processes will
be running with some scheduling policy like Round Rabin, FIFO etc..
High priority process will get more CPU Time.

nice command is used to run the given command with its scheduling
priority adjusted. Priority range goes from -20 (highest priority) 
to 19 (lowest priority).

Examples:

$ nice -- Prints the current priority value.

$ nice ls -- Increment the priority value of the ls command 
             by 10 (Default value) and run.

$ nice -n 5 ls -- Increment the priority value of the ls command
                  by 5 and run.

# nice -n -2 ls -- Decrement the priority value of the ls command by 
                   -2 and run.

NOTE: Incrementing the priority value will reduce the priority level 
      and vice versa. Priority range is -20 (high) to 19 (low).
