One Day One Command 
===================

deallocvt -- Deallocate Unused Virtual Consoles.

Summary:

The command deallocvt deallocates kernel memory and data structures 
for all *UNUSED* virtual consoles.

When you do 'openvt', a new virtual console will be created on the
next free terminal. After using that, We can deallocate it using the
'deallocvt' command.

Examples:

# openvt -s ls -- Run the 'ls' on next free VT (mostly on 7).

# deallocvt -- Deallocate unused VT. Now switch to 7(?), you won't 
               see any change on the screen.

# deallocvt 7 -- Deallocate /dev/tty7, if it is unused.
