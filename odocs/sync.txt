One Day One Command 
===================

sync -- Flush File System Buffers.

Summary:

The Linux Kernel keeps data in memory to avoid doing (relatively slow)  
disk reads and writes.  This improves performance, but if the computer
crashes, data in memory may be lost or the file system corrupted as a
result.

`sync' used to Synchronize data on disk with memory. 'sync' writes any
data buffered in memory out to disk.

Examples:

$ sync -- Write buffered data to disk.
