One Day One Command :-
====================

mount  -- Mount/Attach a File System to a File Tree.

Summary :

All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree,
the file hierarchy, rooted at /.  These files can be spread out over
several devices. The mount command serves to attach the file system
found on some device to the big file tree.

$ mount  -- List all mounted FSs (FileSystem).

$ mount -l -- List all mounted FSs with Labels.

# mount -a -- Mount all entries in the /etc/fstab.

# mount /mnt/cdrom -- Mount known device to cdrom dir. Mount will find 
                      the cdrom device (/dev/hdX) from /etc/fstab.

# mount /dev/hdd -- Mount device at the known place. Mount will find 
                    the mount point (Ex. /mnt/cdrom) from /etc/fstab.

# mount -t ext2 /dev/hda2 /tmp/dir1 -- Mount a Linux partition at 
                                       /tmp/dir1.

# mount -t vfat -o rw,umask=0007 /dev/hda1 /mnt/C -- Mount Windows FAT  
partition

# mount -o rw /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy/ -t vfat -- Mount FAT format floppy 
in Read and write mode.

# mount -t nfs 192.168.14.155:/home/one /home/one -- Mount NFS
partition, from a machine with particular IP, to /home/one dir.

# mount /tmp/fdimage /mnt/test1 -t msdos -o loop=/dev/loop3,blocksize=1024 
-- Mount msdos Floppy disk image via loopback device.

# mount /tmp/cdimg.iso /mnt/test1 -t iso9660 -o loop=/dev/loop3,blocksize=1024 
-- Mount a CD iso image via loopback device.

# mount --bind /mnt/cdrom /mnt/test1 -- Mount the /mnt/cdrom in
another location. So you can access in the FS in two places.

# mount -t tmpfs none /mnt/test1 -o rw,size=1m -- Mount a tmpFS 

# mount -t tmpfs none /mnt/test1 -o remount,ro,size=1m -- Remount the 
same partition with different permission.

# mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt -- Mount a NTFS (Default - Read Only)
