factor -- Print prime factors

Summary:

Print the prime factors of each number.The algorithm it uses is not
very sophisticated, so for some inputs `factor' runs for a long time.

Example:

$ factor 25 -- Print prime factors

$ factor 125 200 -- Print prime factors for each number.

$ factor `echo '2^64-1'|bc` -- Factors the largest 64-bit number.

$ factor `echo '4294967279 * 4294967291'|bc` -- Factors the largest
                 32-bit prime numbers. (Warning: It take more time)
