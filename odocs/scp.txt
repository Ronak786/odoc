scp -- Secure remote file Copy Program.

Summary:

scp copies files between computers on a network. It uses ssh for data
transfer, & uses the same authentication & provides the same security
as ssh. The SSH Daemon must be running in the remote computer to do
the scp.

Examples:

$ scp file1 remote at MyServer:~/ -- Copy local file1 to Home Dir of
                                   the remote account on MyServer.

$ scp -p file1 remote at MyServer:~/ -- Preserves modification times, 
                   access times, and modes from the original file.

$ scp -r MyDir remote at MyServer:~/ -- Recursively copy entire MyDir.

$ scp -q file1 remote at MyServer:~/ -- Disables the default progress bar.

$ scp -v file1 remote at MyServer:~/ -- Verbose Mode.

$ scp remote at MyServer:~/file2 . -- Copy the file2 from remote account 
                                   on MyServer to the local host.

For Windows: SSH Client is Putty and SCP Client is WinSCP.
