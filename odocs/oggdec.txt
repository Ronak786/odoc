One Day One Command 
===================

oggdec -- Decodes Ogg into PCM Audio format.

Summary:

Ogg Vorbis is a new audio compression format. It is different from
these other formats because it is completely free, open & unpatented.
It is roughly comparable to other formats used to store & play digital
music, such as MP3, VQF, AAC, and other digital audio formats.

oggdec decodes Ogg Vorbis files into PCM-encoded ("uncompressed")  
audio files, either WAV or RAW format.  For each input file, oggdec
writes to a filename based on the input filename, but with the extn
changed to ".wav" or ".raw".


Examples:

$ locate .ogg -- Search for some OGG files in your system.

$ oggdec in.ogg -- Decode in.ogg and writes to in.wav file.

$ oggdec --raw=1 in.ogg -- Decode in.ogg and writes to in.raw file.

$ oggdec in.ogg -o out.wav -- Decode in.ogg and writes to out.wav file.
