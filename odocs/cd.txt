One Day One Command :-
====================

cd -- Change the Current Directory

Summary : 

cd is bash shell's built-in command. It is used to change the present
working Dir to specific Dir.

Examples :

$ cd -- Change the current Dir to $HOME ($HOME is the default).

$ cd ~ -- Same as above.

$ cd ~sbharathi -- Goto the Home Dir of sbharathi.

$ cd myprj -- Change the current Dir to myprj.

$ cd .. -- Goto the parent Dir.

$ cd -  -- Goto the last visited Dir.

TIP: 

CDPATH - Easy access to frequently used Dirs. For example, I use
/usr/a/dir1, /usr/b/dir2/ and /usr/c/dir3 very frequently. So I added
the above dirs CDPATH like this

CDPATH=/usr/a/dir1/:/usr/b/dir2/:/usr/c/dir3/

Now there no need for me to type exact path to cd. Just cd dir1 will
cd to /usr/a/dir1. Actually cd will looks into CDPATH before doing the
action.

Note:
1) Before changing to new path, cd will save the old path in the 
   $OLDPWD evn variable.
2) After changing to new path, cd will save the new path in the $PWD 
   env variable.
