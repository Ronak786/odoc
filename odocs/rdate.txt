One Day One Command :-
====================

rdate -- Get the time from Remote machine. 

Summary :

It connects to an Remote Time Server over a TCP/IP network, printing
the returned time and/or setting the system clock. The time in remote
server is maintained properly. So that all machines can get the time
from that server.

Example:

$ rdate -p 192.168.1.5 -- Print the time returned by the remote 
                          machine.

$ rdate -s remote.pc.com -- Set the system time to the time returned 
                        by the remote machine (Need Root permission).

$ rdate -u myserver -- Use UDP instead of TCP as the transport.

$ rdate -l myserver -- Use syslog to log errors and output (Useful 
                       when it is used in cron jobs).

NOTE:
1) Remote server should run the time service in port 37.
2) Firewall should not block port 37.
