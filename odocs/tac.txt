One Day One Command
===================

tac -- Concatenate and Print files in reverse order.

Summary:

`tac' copies each file to standard output, reversing the records
(lines by default) in each separately. It is doing the reverse
function of the CAT command (TAC).

Example:

$ tac myfile -- Print the file (Line by Line) in reverse order.

$ tac -r -s '[^a-zA-z0-9\-]' myfile -- Print the file (Word by Word)  
                 in reverse order, by passing the Regular expression.

$ tac -r -s '.\|' myfile -- Print the file (Char by Char) in reverse 
                            order.
