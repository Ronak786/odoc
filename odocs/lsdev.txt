One Day One Command 
===================

lsdev - Display information about installed hardware

Summary:

lsdev gathers information about your computer's installed hardware
from the interrupts, ioports and dma files in the /proc directory,
thus giving you a quick overview of which hardware uses what I/O
addresses and what IRQ and DMA channels.

This program only shows the kernel's idea of what hardware is present,
not what's actually physically available.

Examples:

$ lsdev

Read: man lsdev
