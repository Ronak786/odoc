One Day One Command
===================

sum -- Compute and Check .

Summary:

`sum' computes a 16-Bit checksum for each given file(s)/stdin. By
default, it computes checksums using an algorithm compatible with 
BSD `sum' and prints file sizes in units of 1024-byte blocks.

Example:

$ sum file -- Print checksum and block counts.

$ sum file1 file2 -- Print checksum, block counts and filename.

$ sum -r file -- Default. Use BSD sum algorithm (1KB/Block).

$ sum -s file -- Use System V sum algorithm (512 bytes/Block).
