One Day One Command 
===================

mii-tool -- Show/Check/Set the MII status.

Summary:

MII (Media Independent Interface) is a standard bus which connects
network interface controllers to physical media interfaces (PHYs).
PHYs are usually located on a network interface card itself, but there
are cards available which have external MII connectors for attaching
external PHYs.

mii-tool display/checks/sets the status of a network interface's MII
unit.  Most fast Ethernet adapters use an MII to autonegotiate link
speed and duplex setting.

Examples:

# mii-tool -- Show shot status info about the network card.

# mii-tool -v -- Show detailed status.

# mii-tool -R -- Reset the MII unit to default value.

# mii-tool -r -- Restart the Auto Negotiation.

# mii-tool -w -- Watch the network interface and show if there is any 
       change in the status.(Run it and remove & reconnect the cable).

# mii-tool -F 10baseT-HD -- Forcibly set the capability to 10Mpbs and 
                            Half Duplex mode.

# mii-tool -A 10baseT-HD, 10baseT-FD -- Enable and restart Auto
        Negotiation, and advertise only the specified capabilities.
