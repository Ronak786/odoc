One Day One Command :-
====================

hostid - Print the numeric id for the host.

Summary:

It will print a 32-bit hexadecimal numerical identifier for the host
machine. Certain product registration procedures use this number to
brand a particular user license. The 32-bit quantity happens to be
closely related to the system's IP address, but that isn't always the
case.

If your IP address is 192.168.14.155 then your hostid is A8C09B0E.

A8 -- 168
C0 -- 192
9B -- 155
0E -- 14

Example:

$ hostid -- Print the hostid of the current host.
