One Day One Command 
===================

route -- Show / Manipulate the IP routing table.

Summary:

Route manipulates the kernel's IP routing tables. Its primary use is
to set up static routes to specific hosts or networks via a network
interface (like eth0 ...).

Example:

$ route -- Show routing table. It will try resolve the name for IP.

$ route -n -- Same as above. But won't resolve.

$ route -ee -- Show more detailed info.

$ route -A inet6 -- Show IPv6 related route info.

# route add -net 127.0.0.0 -- Adds the normal loopback entry.

# route add -net 192.168.14.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0 -- Adds 
                     a route to the network 192.168.14.x via "eth0".

# route add default gw midas-gw dev eth1 -- Set the default Gateway 
                                            for eth1.

# route del default dev eth0 -- Remove the default Gateway of eth0.

# route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 reject -- Sets rejecting  
                                       route  for  the "10.x.x.x."

# route add -net 192.168.13.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw wify1 -- Adds 
               the net "192.168.13.x" to be gatewayed through wify1.
