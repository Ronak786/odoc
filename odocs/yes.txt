One Day One Command :-
====================

yes -- Print a string until interrupted

Summary :

It prints the command line arguments, separated by spaces & followed
by a newline, forever until it is killed. 'yes' can be used to feeds a
continuous string of the character to another process and create dummy
process for learning the process control.

Example:

$ yes -- Prints `y' followed by a newline until killed.

$ yes Midas -- Prints `Midas' followed by a newline until killed.

$ yes `cat myfile` -- Print myfile content until killed.

$ yes | fsck /dev/hda1 -- Runs fsck non-interactively.

$ yes | rm -r mydir -- Same effect as rm -rf mydir.

$ yes > /dev/null & -- Dummy process.
