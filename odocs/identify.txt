One Day One Command (By Mr Arpit Sud)
======================================

identify -- Describe an image.

Summary:

Identify describes the format and characteristics of one or more image
files. It will also report if an image is incomplete or corrupt.  The
information displayed includes the scene number, the file name, the
width and height of the image, whether the image is color mapped or
not, the number of colors in the image, the number of bytes in the
image, the format of the image (JPEG, PNM, etc.), and finally the
number of seconds it took to read and process the image.

It is a part of the ImageMagick utilities (www.imagemagick.org).

Examples:

$ identify img.png -- Show short info about the image.

$ identify a.miff b.png c.jpg d.gif -- Show short info about all 
                                       image files.

$ identify -verbose img.jpg -- Show detailed info about the image.

Read: man identify
