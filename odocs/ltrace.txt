One Day One Command 
===================

ltrace -- Library call TRACEr

Summary:

ltrace is a program that simply runs the specified command until it
exits and intercepts & records the library/system calls, which are
called by the executed process, and the signals, which are received by
that process. It can used study the internal flow of a program.

Examples:

$ ltrace sleep 1 -- Trace all Lib call of 'sleep' command.

$ ltrace ls -- Trace all Lib call of 'ls' command.

$ ltrace -d sleep 1 -- Print more detailed info.

$ ltrace -i sleep 1 -- Print the value of the Instruction Pointer at 
                       every lib call.

$ ltrace -S sleep 1 -- Show System Call trace also.

$ ltrace -S -L sleep 1 -- Show only System calls.

$ ltrace -r sleep 1 -- Print a relative time-stamp with each line of
                       the trace.

$ ltrace -t sleep 1 -- Prefix each line of the trace with the time of
                       day.

$ ltrace -o file sleep 1 -- Redirect the output to a file.

$ sleep 60 & -- Dummy background Job.

$ ltrace -p 1234 -- Attach to the process with the PID 1234 (use dummy 
                    job's Pid) and trace.

$ ltrace -n 3 sleep 1 -- Indent each new nested call by 3 Spaces.
