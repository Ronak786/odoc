tee - Read from stdin and write to stdout and files

Summary : 

Tee will copy the stdin to file(s) and also to stdout output. Actually
tee is doing the redirection. The following ASCII art will shows "How
Tee works".

StdIn >---+---> StdOut
          |
          |
          |
          V 
        File(s)

Examples :

$ tee   -- Read from stdin and write into stdout.

$ tee f1 f2 -- Read from stdin and write into stdout, f1 & f2.

$ tee -i myfile -- Same as above. But it will ignore the interrupt 
                   signals (Ex: ctrl+C).

$ tee -a myfile -- Read from stdin and write into stdout & append to
                   myfile.

$ who | tee myfile -- Store the output of who to myfile and also write 
                      to stdout.

$ ls -1 | tee f1 f2 | wc -l -- Store the ls output in f1, f2 & write
                               the count of all files on stdout.
