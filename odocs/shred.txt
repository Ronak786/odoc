One Day One Command
===================

shred -- Overwrite/Delete a file securely.

Summary:

Overwrite the specified file repeatedly and remove, in order to make
it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the
data.

Example:

$ shred file -- Repeatedly overwrite the file content with random data.

$ shred -v file -- Show progress info.

$ shred -n 5 file -- Overwrite 5 times instead of the default is 25.

$ shred -x file -- Use exact size. Don't round of.

$ shred -z file -- At the end of shred, overwrite the file with zeros.

$ shred -u file -- Overwrite, Truncate and Remove the file.
