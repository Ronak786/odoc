One Day One Command :-
====================

fold -- Wrap each input line to fit in specified width.

Summary :

`fold' wrap input lines in each input file and writes the output to
standard output. `fold' counts screen columns by default.

Examples :

$ fold myfile -- Fold each input line at column 80 and print in the
                 screen/stdout.

$ fold -w 40 myfile > myfile1 -- Fold each input line at column 40 and
                                 the output is redirected to myfile1.

$ fold -s -w40 f1 f2 -- Fold each input line of f1 and f2 at column 40
                        and folding will happen at space only.

$ fold -b 40 myfile -- Folds at 40th byte place.

$ fold -c 40 myfile -- Folds at 40th character position.


Note:
1) Normally all the above options will give same output. Difference
can be felt only with multi-byte encodings, like UTF-8...

2) A tab may count more than one column, backspace decreases the
column count, and carriage return sets the column to zero.
