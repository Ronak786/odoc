One Day One Command 
===================

c++decl -- Create/Explain C++ Type Declarations.

Summary:

Cdecl is a program for encoding and decoding C/C++ type declarations
in English language. Both cdecl and c++decl are same program. cdecl
will use C notation and c++decl use C++. It can run in interactive
(shell-like) and non-interactive mode (command line arguments).

In the interactive mode, cdecl will wait for your input in "c++decl> " 
prompt. Enter "quit or exit" to exit. Enter "?" for help.

Examples:

$ c++decl -- Start the c++decl in interactive mode.

c++decl> quit -- Exit c++decl.

c++decl> declare i as static integer 

c++decl> declare x as reference to pointer to character

c++decl> declare foo as pointer to member of class X int

c++decl> explain class Y *(X::*foo)(arg1, arg2)

$ c++decl -c declare signal as function returning int -- Create 
                            compilable C or C++ code as output.
