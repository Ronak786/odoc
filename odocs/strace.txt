One Day One Command 
===================

strace -- Trace System Calls and Signals.

Summary:

In the simplest case strace runs the specified command until it exits.  
It intercepts and records the system calls which are called by a
process and the signals which are received by a process.  The name of
each system call, its arguments and its return value are printed.
strace is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool.

Examples:

$ strace sleep 1 -- Trace all Sys call of 'sleep' command.

$ strace ls -- Trace all Sys call of 'ls' command.

$ strace -i sleep 1 -- Print the value of the Instruction Pointer at
                       every sys call.

$ strace -r sleep 1 -- Print a relative time-stamp with each line of
                       the trace.

$ strace -t sleep 1 -- Prefix each line of the trace with the time of
                       day.

$ strace -T sleep 1 -- Show time spent on each call.

$ strace -o file sleep 1 -- Redirect the output to a file.

$ strace -c ls -- Count  time,  calls, and errors for each system call
                   and report a summary on program exit.

$ strace -xx myprg -- Print all strings in HEX format.

$ strace -e trace=file ls -- Trace all system calls which take a
                             filename as an argument. 

$ strace -e trace=process ls -- Trace all system calls which involve
                                process management.

$ sleep 60 & -- Dummy background Job.

$ strace -p 1234 -- Attach to the process with the PID 1234 (use 
                    dummy job's Pid) and trace.
