One Day One Command 
===================

ogginfo -- Gives information about Ogg files.

Summary:

Ogg Vorbis is a new audio compression format. It is different from
these other formats because it is completely free, open & unpatented.
It is roughly comparable to other formats used to store & play digital
music, such as MP3, VQF, AAC, and other digital audio formats.

ogginfo reads one or more Ogg files and prints information about
stream contents. It will detect (but not correct)  a wide range of
common defects, with many additional checks specifically for Ogg
Vorbis streams.

Examples:

$ locate .ogg -- Search for some OGG files in your system.

$ ogginfo /usr/share/redhat-credits.ogg -- Show the detailed info 
                                           about that ogg file.

$ ogginfo -q /usr/share/redhat-credits.ogg -- Show warning and errors
                                              messages.

$ ogginfo -qq /usr/share/redhat-credits.ogg -- Show only errors.
